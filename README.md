# Eck-s-Campaign-Helper-backend-
I needed a real project to better help my learning efforts for some cloud computing technologies. It'll also serve as an example for potential employers. My plan is to make some AI assisted tools that will be useful for DM's and learn some cloud computing stuff along the way. It's still very early days, but I'm making good progress.

I started this project in early January 2024, but it isn't the only thing I'm working on. Monday and Friday, I'm dedicated to coding on this project. But Tuesday and Thursday, I'm focused on working towards my IBM Full Stack Cert which is made up of 12 other certs. I'm burning through a couple weeks of classes each day. Take a look at my progress here: [Certificates](https://ecktechgames.com/certifications/). And Wednesday is a wild card day. It might be programming, it might be learning, or it might be RPG prep for a Rogue Trader game that I'm running for my daughter.

Overall Goal:
* Make a helper app to generate random NPC's for an RPG campaign like Dungeons & Dragons.
* Ask ChatGPT to write a cool description for those NPC's.
* Ask MidJourney to make some character art for those NPC's.
* Store all that stuff in in the database so people can browse it.
