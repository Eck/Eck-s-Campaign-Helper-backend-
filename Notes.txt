Overall Goal:
Make a helper app to generate random NPC's for an RPG campaign like Dungeons & Dragons.
Ask ChatGPT to write a cool description for those NPC's.
Ask MidJourney to make some character art for those NPC's.
Store all that stuff in in the database so people can browse it.


Getting the ChatGPT stuff call was super easy thanks to the package. But I don't want to burn through my free credits, during testing. :) Instead, I'm going to mock up responses, and swap that out for the real thing later.


TODO:
X - Mock ChatGPT request basic function call.
X - Mock some Question/Answer storage so it can actually pretend to be OpenAI.
  - Wire up a Database Maybe Sqlite maybe MySQL
  - Create DataModel / Database Seed scripts for the app.
  - CRUD pages for an NPC, maybe even CRUD pages for the dropdowns, Race, Class, Gender, etc. so people can add what's missing.
  - Look up a dependency injection framework instead of hardcoding my MOCK OpenAI class. Then we can drive stuff off of configuration
