Overall Goal:
Make a helper app to generate random NPC's for an RPG campaign like Dungeons & Dragons.
Ask ChatGPT to write a cool description for those NPC's.
Ask MidJourney to make some character art for those NPC's.
Store all that stuff in in the database so people can browse it.


Getting the ChatGPT stuff call was super easy thanks to the package. But I don't want to burn through my free credits, during testing. :) Instead, I'm going to mock up responses, and swap that out for the real thing later.


TODO:
  - Mock ChatGPT request
  - Wire up a Database Maybe Sqlite maybe MySQL
  - Create DataModel / Database Seed scripts for the app.
  - CRUD pages for an NPC, maybe even CRUD pages for the dropdowns, Race, Class, Gender, etc. so people can add what's missing.
