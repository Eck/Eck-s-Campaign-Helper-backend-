Getting the ChatGPT stuff call was super easy thanks to the package. But I don't want to burn through my free credits, during testing. :) Instead, I'm going to mock up responses, and swap that out for the real thing later.


TODO:
X - Mock ChatGPT request basic function call.
X - Mock some Question/Answer storage so it can actually pretend to be OpenAI.
X - Wire up a Sqlite Database 
/ - Create DataModel / Database Seed scripts for the app.
  - CRUD pages for an NPC, maybe even CRUD pages for the dropdowns, Race, Class, Gender, etc. so people can add what's missing.
  - Look up a dependency injection framework instead of hardcoding my MOCK OpenAI class. Then we can drive stuff off of configuration
